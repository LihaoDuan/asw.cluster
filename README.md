asw.cluster R package for calculating group faultlines

# Help Wanted!

I am looking for someone who can help to maintain this package (i.e., help fixing future bugs and maybe help develop it further). If you know about faultlines and are an expert in R, in programming packages in R, and know how to use gitHub, please drop me a line at bertolt dot meyer at psychologie dot tu-chemnitz dot de.
